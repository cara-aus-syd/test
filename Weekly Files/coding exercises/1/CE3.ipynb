    "# Week 3 - Coding Exercise\n",
    "This notebook **is the deliverable** for your weekly coding exercises. Below you will find the text of the exercise and the space to write your code. Feel free to **add additional code cells** if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Completion Instructions\n",
    "1. Some exercises will ask you to perform a calculation and assign the result to a variable with a **specific name**. Assigning the result to a variable with the wrong name will result in **0 marks** for that point.\n",
    "1. Some exercises will ask you to perform a calculation and assign the result to a varaible of a **specific type** (number, Series, DataFrame, etc.). Assigning the result to a variable of the wrong type will result in **0 marks** for that point. You can check the type of an object with the function **[`type()`](https://www.codingem.com/type-of-in-python/)**.\n",
    "1. The **final result** of each point should be **shown on screen**. For example if you are asked to assign the result of a calculation to a number called `Total`, this number should be visible on screen. If the result is a DataFrame or Series you should show only a few rows with **[`df.head()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.head.html)** or, if more appropriate, **[`df.tail()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.tail.html)**. If a final result is not shown on screen, it will lead to **0 marks** for that point.\n",
    "1. You should not \"hard-code\" numbers into your calculations if this can be avoided. For example if you need to use the \"number of columns\" in a DataFrame in a calculation, you should use a command/function to calculate the number of columns and not simply count the columns and use `7` (a hard-coded number) in your calculations. Using hard-coded numbers when this is unnecessary may result in **0 marks** for that point. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission Instructions\n",
    "1. Do not change the **name of the file**. Canvas will automatically add your name and student ID to the file. (**Attention:** If you submit multiple times in Canvas, the software will automatically add a number at the end of your file name. This is ok).\n",
    "1. Before submitting the notebook please **check that it runs properly** from top to bottom. To do this, save the file, close it, then re-open it and press the fast-forward button at the top of the notebook or _Restart and Run All Cells_ from the _Kernel_ menu. You can see a discussion of this in this [video](https://youtu.be/P0NyuTGddPo). If your file has a breaking error that does not allow us to run the notebook from top to bottom you will receive a **penalty of 5 marks**. \n",
